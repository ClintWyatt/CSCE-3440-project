            Ryan Schick is this project's Senior Front End Developer with deep knowledge of Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Ryan carried the aesthetic design 
            throughout the website design, especially the home and about webpages. With a keen eye for design and properly putting together lettering, size, flow, 
            and color, he was able to have the website come together. Ryan was able to take feedback from a test group to fully turn around the design and also 
            use web scrapping to give live updates and news for the COVID-19 outbreak, the primary reason for the team to start this project.
