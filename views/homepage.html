                   <p>A 55-year-old individual from Hubei province in China may have been the first person to have contracted COVID-19, the
                        disease caused by the new coronavirus spreading across the globe. That case dates back to Nov. 17, 2019, according to
                        the South China Morning Post.</p>
                    <p>On February 11, 2020 the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank">World Health Organiation[1]</a> announced
                    an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019
                    novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019,
                    abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this
                    disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV” COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe 
                    underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications
                    from COVID-19 illness. Some symptoms of Orthocoronavirinae are fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, 
                    new loss of taste or smell, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/black-death#:~:text=The%20Black%20Death%20was%20a,the%20Sicilian%20port%20of%20Messina." target="_blank">
                    Black Plague[2]</a> was a devastating global epidemic of bubonic plague that struck Europe and Asia in the mid-1300s. The
                plague arrived in Europe in October 1347, when 12 ships from the Black Sea docked at the Sicilian port of Messina.
                People gathered on the docks were met with a horrifying surprise: Most sailors aboard the ships were dead, and those
                still alive were gravely ill and covered in black boils that oozed blood and pus.</p>
                <p>Today, it's best known as the Black Death or the bubonic plague. Medieval people called it "the blue sickness," La pest
                ("the Pestilence"), and "the Great Mortality." The name bubonic comes from the medieval Latin word bubo via Italian
                bilbo--meaning a pustule, growth, or swelling. Some symptoms of the disease were fever, trembling, weakness, and profuse sweating are initial symptoms of 
                the bubonic version. In the pneumatic version, coughing and parched throats are additional symptoms. In advanced cases, the most distinctive sign is the agonizing rise
                of dark "buboes": sensitive black-blue swellings under the armpit and near the groin--spots where dead blood and pus
                builds up in the lymph nodes. If the buboes are not lanced, the buildup of infected blood will cause the buboes in the
                armpit and groin area to expand in size (typically the swelling is about golf-ball sized, but sometimes as large as
                softballs). Untreated, the patient will die from the buildup of dead blood in these buboes. On the other hand, lancing
                the bilbo or popping it can still kill the victim from toxic shock, and the spray from the bubo is profoundly infectious
                to those who come into contact with it.</p>
